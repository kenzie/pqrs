# PQRS

Test driven rewrite of Patient360 app. Rethinking how Encounters and Measures/Groups are organized – simplifying the models and starting without persistence to keep it really clean.

## Individual Encounter

Captures numerator/denominator answers.

## Individual Measure

Loads measure data from a file and sets up numerator/denominator questions and validations.
